# My First Jetpack Compose App 


### This is my first APP with Jetpack Compose UI Android

The first screen of the APP was designed the layout of the main screen of Instagram, made in Jetpack Compose:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/instagram_screen.png" width="260px" height="550px"</img> 
</div>

Clicking on the Floating Button that appears in the lower corner of the screen, you are redirected to the Form screen, which has text fields, only for studies of Jetpack components:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/form_screen.png" width="260px" height="550px"</img> 
</div>
